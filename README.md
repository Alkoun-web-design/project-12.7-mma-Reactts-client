# React and TypeScript frontend for Mind Muscles Website

The frontend was AI generated on the request fo the client. However specific changes were made in the code to accomodate data retrieval from a Database, and a login system for Admins and others. Only the Admins have access to a CMS for editing the content of the website.

Important Note: The website is using a mysql database and is currently undergoing a transfer to a SQLite database. Visitors will nyo be able to access content until the transfer is done.
